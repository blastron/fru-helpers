P1_FOF_EXPLAIN_CONGA,"Four random players will be assigned tethers in a sequence. These tethers will resolve after a short delay, at which point some number of cones will fire at nearby players. In order to determine who has a tether and who baits what, line up in a conga line and wait for the tethers to go out."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_EXPLAIN_TETHER_ONE,"Here, the first tether is fire. When a fire tether resolves, it shoots a single cone at the nearest player. A minimum of three players must be hit by this cone, otherwise everyone receives a big damage down. Fire tethers are placed north, so that the cone will always be baited directly south, catching the other three players. As this is an odd-numbered tether, it is placed on the west."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_EXPLAIN_TETHER_TWO,"The second tether is lightning. When a lightning tether resolves, it shoots three very wide cones at the three closest players. Lightning tethers are placed center on their side, so that the three cones are baited north, south, and out. As this is an even-numbered tether, it is placed on the east."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_EXPLAIN_TETHER_THREE,"The third tether player moves west to bait the first set of cones. It is not yet important what their tether is, as the baits are always the same. Since the first tether is fire, the third tether player stands in the center to bait the single cone south."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_EXPLAIN_TETHER_FOUR,"The fourth tether player moves east to bait the second set of cones. Since the second tether is lightning, the fourth tether player moves north to bait their cone north, away from the rest of the party."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_EXPLAIN_CONGA_BAITS,"The remaining players determine where to stand by checking their position in the conga line. The player furthest to the left moves to the furthest bait spot on the west side and the second-furthest from the left moves to the southern bait spot on the west side. This is mirrored on the right side, where the player furthest to the right moves to the spot furthest east and the second-furthest player moves to the southern spot. These players will remain in these positions for the remainder of this mechanic."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_EXPLAIN_SHOT_ONE,"The first tether resolves. Afterward, the third tether player determines where to stand. Since the west tethers were different elements, the third tether player is already in the correct spot to place their lightning cones, so they do not need to swap with the other tether player."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_EXPLAIN_SHOT_TWO,"The second tether resolves, and the fourth tether player determines where to stand. Since the east tethers are both the same element, the fourth tether player needs to swap with the other tether player, because the other player is currently in the spot for placing fire tethers."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_EXPLAIN_FINAL_SHOTS,The third and fourth tethers resolve.
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_FAILED_BAIT_ONE,"As the player on the far left side of the remaining conga line, you needed to go to the outermost spot on the west side."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_FAILED_BAIT_TWO,"As the player second-closest to the left in the remaining conga line, you needed to go to the southern spot on the west side."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_FAILED_BAIT_THREE,"As the player second-closest to the right in the remaining conga line, you needed to go to the southern spot on the east side."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_FAILED_BAIT_FOUR,"As the player on the far right side of the remaining conga line, you needed to go to the outermost spot on the east side."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_FAILED_WRONG_TETHER_SIDE_WEST,"As a player with an odd-numbered tether, you are always in the west group."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_FAILED_WRONG_TETHER_SIDE_EAST,"As a player with an even-numbered tether, you are always in the east group."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_FAILED_TETHER_BAIT_FIRE,"Since the other tethered player in your group had a fire tether, you needed to stand south of them, in the center, to bait the shared cone due south."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_FAILED_TETHER_BAIT_LIGHTNING,"Since the other tethered player in your group had a lightning tether, you needed to stand north of them to bait your individual cone north."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_FAILED_FIRE_ADDENDUM,"Although the fuss-free strat is very forgiving for improperly-baited fire cones, you should still stand in the center for consistency's sake."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_FAILED_TETHER_PLACE_FIRE,"Since you had a fire tether, you needed to stand to the north of your group, so that the shared cone can be baited south."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_FAILED_TETHER_PLACE_LIGHTNING,"Since you had a lightning tether, you needed to stand in the center of your group, so that the other players could bait their individual cones away from each other."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_FAILED_DID_NOT_SWAP_OUT,"The other tether player had the same element as you did, so you needed to swap places with them so that they could place their tether and you could bait your cone correctly."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_FAILED_DID_NOT_SWAP_IN,"The other tether player had the same element as you did, so you needed to swap places with them so that you could place your tether and they could bait their cone correctly."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_FAILED_UNNECESSARY_SWAP,"You and the other tether player on your side had different elements, so you did not need to swap with them, as you were already in the correct locations."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_FAILED_SWAP_FIRE,"Fire tethers are always placed north of the group, and the shared cone is always baited south."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_FAILED_SWAP_LIGHTNING,"Lightning tethers are always placed in the center of the group, and the other tether player on that side always baits their individual cone north."
