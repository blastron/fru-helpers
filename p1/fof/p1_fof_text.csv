P1_FOF_EXPLAIN_CONGA,"Four random players will be assigned tethers of random types, one after the other. These tethers will resolve after a short delay, at which point some number of cones will fire at nearby players.\nIn order to determine who has a tether and who baits what, line up in a conga line and wait for the tethers to go out."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_EXPLAIN_TETHER_ONE,"Here, the first tether is [b]fire[/b]. When a fire tether resolves, it shoots a single cone at the nearest player that must be soaked by a total of three other players.\nFire tethers are placed [b]north[/b] of the group, so that the cone will always be baited south at the other three players.\nAs this is an odd-numbered tether, it is placed in the west."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_EXPLAIN_TETHER_TWO,"The second tether is [b]lightning[/b]. When a lightning tether resolves, it shoots three very wide cones at the three closest players.\nLightning tethers are placed at the [b]center[/b] of their group, so that the cones are baited north, south, and out, leaving a safe spot for the other group.\nAs this is an even-numbered tether, it is placed on the east."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_EXPLAIN_TETHER_THREE,"The third tether player moves west into position to bait the first set of cones. Since the first tether is [b]fire[/b], the player stands in the [b]center[/b] to bait the cone south.\nIt doesn’t yet matter what type of tether the third player has; their position is fixed."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_EXPLAIN_TETHER_FOUR,"The fourth tether player moves east to bait the second set of cones. Since the second tether is [b]lightning[/b], the player stands [b]north[/b] to bait their cone away from the group.\nAgain, their own tether type does not yet matter."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_EXPLAIN_FIRST_BAITS,"The remaining players determine where to stand by checking their relative position in the conga line. The two players on the outside of the line go to the outermost spots on each side, and the two players on the inside go to the southern spots.\nThese positions are fixed for the entirety of the mechanic, regardless of the elements of the tethers."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_EXPLAIN_SHOT_ONE,"The first tether resolves, baited south to hit the whole western group."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_EXPLAIN_SHOT_TWO,"The second tether resolves, with three cones baited north, east, and south, leaving a safe spot for the west party."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_EXPLAIN_SECOND_BAITS,"The tether players determine whether or not to swap with each other. Players who have the [b]same[/b] element need to swap, since cones of the same element are baited identically. Players who have [b]different[/b] elements are already in the correct locations to bait their cones and do not need to move.\nHere, the west players have different elements, so they stay where they are. The third tether is lightning, which gets placed in the center, so H1 is already in the correct spot.\nThe east players both have lightning, so T2 needs to move to the center, swapping places with R1.\nThe remaining players don’t move, as their bait positions are fixed."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_EXPLAIN_FINAL_SHOTS,The third and fourth tethers resolve.
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_FAILED_BAIT_ONE,"As the player on the far left side of the remaining conga line, you needed to go to the outermost spot on the west side."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_FAILED_BAIT_TWO,"As the player second-closest to the left in the remaining conga line, you needed to go to the southern spot on the west side."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_FAILED_BAIT_THREE,"As the player second-closest to the right in the remaining conga line, you needed to go to the southern spot on the east side."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_FAILED_BAIT_FOUR,"As the player on the far right side of the remaining conga line, you needed to go to the outermost spot on the east side."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_FAILED_WRONG_TETHER_SIDE_WEST,"As a player with an odd-numbered tether, you are always in the west group."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_FAILED_WRONG_TETHER_SIDE_EAST,"As a player with an even-numbered tether, you are always in the east group."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_FAILED_TETHER_BAIT_FIRE,"Since the other tethered player in your group had a fire tether, you needed to stand south of them, in the center, to bait the shared cone due south."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_FAILED_TETHER_BAIT_LIGHTNING,"Since the other tethered player in your group had a lightning tether, you needed to stand north of them to bait your individual cone north."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_FAILED_FIRE_ADDENDUM,"Although the fuss-free strat is very forgiving for improperly-baited fire cones, you should still stand in the center for consistency's sake."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_FAILED_TETHER_PLACE_FIRE,"Since you had a fire tether, you needed to stand to the north of your group, so that the shared cone can be baited south."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_FAILED_TETHER_PLACE_LIGHTNING,"Since you had a lightning tether, you needed to stand in the center of your group, so that the other players could bait their individual cones away from each other."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_FAILED_DID_NOT_SWAP_OUT,"The other tether player had the same element as you did, so you needed to swap places with them so that they could place their tether and you could bait your cone correctly."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_FAILED_DID_NOT_SWAP_IN,"The other tether player had the same element as you did, so you needed to swap places with them so that you could place your tether and they could bait their cone correctly."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_FAILED_UNNECESSARY_SWAP,"You and the other tether player on your side had different elements, so you did not need to swap with them, as you were already in the correct locations."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_FAILED_SWAP_FIRE,"Fire tethers are always placed north of the group, and the shared cone is always baited south."
P1_FOF_FUSSLESS_FAILED_SWAP_LIGHTNING,"Lightning tethers are always placed in the center of the group, and the other tether player on that side always baits their individual cone north."
