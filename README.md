# FRU Helpers

This is a set of helpers for explaining and drilling specific strats in FFXIV's Futures Rewritten (Ultimate) raid. It is intended to be useful for internalizing the pattern recognition and decision-making required to successfully solve a mechanic. However, it is not intended as a replacement for running simulations, as it does not handle any timing or movement.

Please note that I am primarily making this for myself and my static, so I will be focusing on implementing mechanics at my current prog point, and strats may differ from NAUR standards if we do something different. As time permits, I will add other mechanics and alternate strats.

### Contact
If you encounter a bug or have a feature request, please open an issue on the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/blastron/fru-helpers/issues).

### Contributing
The underlying goal of this project is to build a framework that allows anyone (who is reasonably skilled in coding) to quickly create new mechanics and strats, with enough built-in functionality to make things about as painless as possible. At the moment, it's not quite done enough for other people to contribute to, but if you're interested in doing so in the future, please contact me.
